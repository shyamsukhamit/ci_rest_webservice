# ci_rest_webservice
This is a working example for restfull webservice in Codeigniter 3.0

The file App.php contains the details of all the webservices.
First import the .sql file in your php myadmin.

Set your database.php in your config folder according your to your need.

Configure the Base url.

and then run the testwebservice.php to see the posting things are working or not.

and the get urls are there in the App.php conntroller.
Curl Library is also there.

Further improvements are always really nice to have.
